## Introduction

Front-end development is a craft that blends creativity, logic, and a bit of user psychology. You’re building interfaces that need to look sharp, run smoothly, and keep users happy. But even the best of us can fall into traps that slow progress or hurt quality. Over the years, I’ve seen these 10 mistakes pop up again and again. Here’s what they are—and how to steer clear.

## 1. Skipping Semantic HTML
It’s tempting to lean on `<div>` for everything—sections, buttons, you name it. But non-semantic HTML is a recipe for trouble: it confuses screen readers, weakens SEO, and makes your code harder to maintain.  

**Fix:** Use semantic selements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<button>` appropriately. Semantic selements bring clarity and power to your markup.

## 2. Ignoring Mobile-First Design
Starting with a desktop layout and then hacking it for mobile is a common pitfall. You end up with a mess of media queries and a design that feels like an afterthought on smaller screens.  

**Fix:** Go mobile-first. Write base styles for small screens, then scale up with `min-width` media queries. It’s cleaner and keeps your priorities straight.

## 3. Over-Relying on Frameworks
Frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind can speed things up, but leaning on them too hard can backfire. Customizations become a slog, and your bundle size balloons.  

**Fix:** Master vanilla CSS and JavaScript first. Use frameworks as accelerators, not foundations, and keep control over your code.

## 4. Not Optimizing Images
Uncompressed, oversized images drag your site’s performance into the dirt. Users won’t stick around for a page that takes forever to load—40% bail after 3 seconds.  

**Fix:** Compress with tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh, switch to WebP where possible, and use `srcset` for responsive delivery. Speed matters.

## 5. Writing Spaghetti CSS
Disorganized CSS—no naming conventions, no structure—turns debugging into a nightmare. A single massive `.css` file is a ticking time bomb.  

**Fix:** Adopt BEM or SMACSS for consistency. Split styles into modular files and manage specificity. Your future self will thank you.

## 6. Forgetting About Accessibility (A11y)
Overlooking keyboard navigation or screen reader support isn’t just careless—it excludes users. Accessibility isn’t optional; it’s essential.  

**Fix:** Test with a keyboard (Tab key is key). Add ARIA attributes, check color contrast, and run tools like Lighthouse to spot gaps.

## 7. Neglecting Browser Compatibility
Building in one browser (looking at you, Chrome) and assuming it’ll work everywhere is a rookie move. Cross-browser bugs will humble you fast.  

**Fix:** Check CanIUse for feature support. Test across browsers with tools like BrowserStack, and have fallbacks or polyfills ready.

## 8. Overcomplicating JavaScript
Writing complex JS for simple tasks—like a toggle that CSS could handle—is a waste of energy. It bloats your code and slows your site.  

**Fix:** Ask: “Can HTML or CSS do this?” Keep JavaScript focused and efficient. Less is often more.

## 9. Not Using Version Control Properly
Vague commits like “fixed stuff” or skipping Git altogether is asking for chaos. Breaking something without a rollback plan is brutal.

**Fix:** Commit small, meaningful changes with clear messages. Learn Git basics (`branch`, `merge`, `revert`)—it’s your safety net.

## 10. Chasing Trends Over Fundamentals
Jumping into the latest library or technique without a solid base is a trap. You’ll end up with shaky skills and unfinished projects.

**Fix:** Nail HTML, CSS, and JS first. Trends fade, but fundamentals keep you versatile and in demand.

## Final Thoughts
Mastering front-end development means recognizing these common mistakes and building habits to avoid them. It’s not about perfection—it’s about precision, from the way you structure your markup to how you optimize for speed. Keep these lessons in mind, and you’ll craft experiences that are robust, user-friendly, and future-proof. The best developers don’t just code—they think ahead.
